# Nornikel_Hackathon_FunkyMonks


This hackathon was conducted by Nornikel with the support of ITMO and PhystechGenesis.

In this project, an optimization task was solved to improve the process of extracting useful metals from pulp.More information about the task can be found at the link: [Full Task](https://buildin.ai/phystech_gensis/share/9250dd0f-aa98-4083-b06c-c7ff06533b16).

The solution was developed by a team of 3rd year students from MPEI. As a result of the competition, our team took the 2nd place.
